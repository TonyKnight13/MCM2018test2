# 结果分析

我们对模型进行实验对比。可以看出，量化因子越大则图片压缩比越大，信噪比越小，图片质量越差。该模型在各种大小的图片上表现差异不是很大。由于各种大小的图片内容差别大，所以指标可能会存在上下波动。信噪比基本稳定在29-41之间，说明解压出来的图片信息没有损失过多。压缩比基本在7 - 25之间，压缩性能良好。可以采用0.5的量化因子进行高质量的压缩。出于减少存储体积大小的考虑，可以使用10以上的量化因子，不过图片信息损失较大。 

We experimented with the model. It can be seen that the larger the quantification factor is, the larger the image compression ratio is, the smaller the signal-to-noise ratio is, and the worse the picture quality is. The model is not very different in different sizes of pictures. Performance indicators may fluctuate due to different sizes of images.
The SNR is basically stable between 29-41, indicating that the extracted image information has not lost much. The compression ratio is between 7 and 25, and the compression performance is good.
A high quality compression can be performed with a quantification factor of 0.5. In order to reduce the size of storage volume, more than 10 quantitative factors can be used, but the loss of image information is large.

可以看出采用自适应中值滤波可以很好的处理掉例图中的噪声，对于所有类似的“椒盐”噪声都可以进行较好的处理。
进行峰值信噪比计算后得到PSNR为31.358，说明去噪的效果比较好。

It can be seen that the adaptive median filter can be used to deal with the noise in the case diagram.
All similar "salt and pepper" noise can be handled well.
When the PSNR was calculated, the PSNR was 31.358, indicating that the denoising effect was better.
