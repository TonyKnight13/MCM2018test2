Model 1
For a digital image using RGB color mode, we first separate the three color channels of red, green and blue.The image data of each channel can be represented by a two-dimensional matrix. Each element in the two-dimensional matrix corresponds to one pixel, and its value is the pixel's gray value. After obtaining the three two-dimensional matrices, we divide them into sub-blocks separately to improve the efficiency of subsequent operations. Our specific operation is to divide the original matrix into sub-blocks of 8 Ã— 8 in order from left to right and from top to bottom. After this step, A sub-block is considered as the basic unit to operate.
There are two things to note about blocking.
* Each value in the two-dimensional matrix needs to be subtracted by 128 before blocking so that the range of each value in the two-dimensional matrix is changed from 0 to 255 to -128 to 127.
* The length or width of the original image is not a multiple of 8, which needs to make up to be multiples of 8 so that the two-dimensional matrix is completely divided into several sub-blocks.
There are three advantages to blocking:
* To facilitate the DCT.
* There are no restrictions on the length-width ratio of the image.
* Take into account the local similarity of the picture.

From article 1, we learned that, The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is a technique for converting a signal into elementary frequency components. It is widely used in image compression.
